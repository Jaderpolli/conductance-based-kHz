## Source codes for the paper: "Dynamical Diversity in Conductance-Based Neuron Response to kilohertz Electrical Stimulation"


In this repository, the [fhh](fhh) folder contain the source codes for running all scripts in [scripts](scripts) folder.
The work has been performed in Python and Julia Languages, therefore both folders contain subfolders with scripts for each language.

To reproduce the results, you can either access the [figures](scripts/figures) folder where all scripts and minimal data files are available to reproduce 
the figures from the paper, or directly play with the multiple scripts in python and julia to generate your own data.
